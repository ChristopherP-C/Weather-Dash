# Weather-Dash

  ## Description
  I wanted to create a website that allows users to check the weather in multiple cities
  This project is made to help people know what weather is like currently and upcoming, both near and far
  This weather dashboard makes it easy for users to check the weather and know what it will be in various places
  This project taught me a lot about Api calls, and the challenges of server side coding
